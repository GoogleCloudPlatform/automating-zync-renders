# Images directory
This directory will contain the final, rendered images generated by ZYNC. Once rendered, images are downloaded by a running ZYNC client.
Renders for each object will be in a subdirectory named after the object. For example:
```
[WORKING-DIRECTORY]/
|____images/
| |____object_001/
| | |____object_001.0001.jpg
| | |____object_001.0002.jpg
| | |____object_001.0003.jpg
| | |____etc...
| |____object_002/
| | |____object_002.0001.jpg
| | |____object_002.0002.jpg
| | |____object_002.0003.jpg
| | |____etc...
| |____object_003/
| | |____object_003.0001.jpg
| | |____object_003.0002.jpg
| | |____object_003.0003.jpg
