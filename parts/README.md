# Parts directory
This directory contains Alembic files to be included for rendering on ZYNC. Files should be named using the template ```part[NUMBER].abc```. Part numbers should be padded to 2 digits. For example:
```
[WORKING-DIRECTORY]/
|____parts/
| |____part01.abc
| |____part02.abc
| |____part03.abc
| |____etc...
```
