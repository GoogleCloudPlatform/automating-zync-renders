# Scenes directory
This directory will contain the assembled scenes, ready to deploy for rendering on ZYNC. Files will be named after their associated object, using the template ```[PART-NAME]_render.ma```. For example:
```
[WORKING-DIRECTORY]/
|____scenes/
| |____part_001_render.ma
| |____part_002_render.ma
| |____part_003_render.ma
| |____etc...
```
