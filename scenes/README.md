# Scenes directory
This directory will contain the assembled scenes, ready to deploy for rendering on ZYNC. Files will be named after their associated object, using the template ```[OBJECT-NAME]_render.ma```. For example:
```
[WORKING-DIRECTORY]/
|____scenes/
| |____object_060_render.ma
| |____object_068_render.ma
| |____object_078_render.ma
| |____etc...
```
