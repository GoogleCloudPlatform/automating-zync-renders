# Objects directory
This directory contains Alembic files to be included for rendering on ZYNC. Files should be named using the template ```object_[NUMBER].abc```. For example:
```
[WORKING-DIRECTORY]/
|____objects/
| |____object_060.abc
| |____object_068.abc
| |____object_078.abc
| |____etc...
```
